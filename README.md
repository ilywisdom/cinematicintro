# Cinematic Intro

Used this on my PoliceRP but figured id make it public bc why not.¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## What does it do?
Pretty much gives you a cool spawn in screen that showcases your map.

## How do I set it up
Doesn't take a genius tbhhhhh.
Mostly everything beside the cam positions are in the sh.config.lua
the cam positions are in cl_intro under sect1 etc.

to set up cam position look & stand where you want the cam to start. do getpos in your console and copy the vectors & angles make sure to put a comma between them except for the last one.

everything else is pretty self explanatory
